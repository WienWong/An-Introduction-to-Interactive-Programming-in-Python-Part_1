# Example Mini-Project:
# THE MYSTICAL OCTOSPHERE! - Andrea Crain
# Template:
# http://www.codeskulptor.org/#exercises-octosphere2_template.py

# Type-your-question version

# Before starting this practice mini-project,
# make sure you've done the week 1 version of the
# Mystical Octosphere. In that version, you had to
# enter your questions into the code at the bottom.

# In week 2 of the class, though, we want to allow
# people to enter their question into an input
# box. It will still display the output in the
# console and use all the same logic as last week.

# Believe it or not, we can do this by adding just 
# three lines of code!

# Let's get started!

# In addition to the random module, we also need to import
# the simplegui module now. That's the library that
# can make a window pop up with an input box.
import random

import simplegui
# Type the command to import the simplegui module above this line
# and make sure it is not indented at all.

# You do not need to change the function number_to_fortune
def number_to_fortune(number):
    if number == 0:
        return "Yes, for sure!"
    elif number == 1:
        return "Probably yes."
    elif number == 2:
        return "Seems like yes..."
    elif number == 3:
        return "Definitely not!"
    elif number == 4:
        return "Probably not."
    elif number == 5:
        return "I really doubt it..."
    elif number == 6:
        return "Not sure, check back later!"
    elif number == 7:
        return "I really can't tell."
    else:
        return "Something was wrong with my input."

# You do not need to change the main function either!
def mystical_octosphere(question):
    print "Your question was... " + question
    print "You shake the mystical octosphere."
    answer_number = random.randrange(0, 8)
    answer_fortune = number_to_fortune(answer_number)
    print "The cloudy liquid swirls, and a reply comes into view..."
    print "The mystical octosphere says... " + answer_fortune    
    print
    

# Here's where we need to add some code.

# In the previous version, we typed lines here
# to run the main function with a question.
# Like this:

# mystical_octosphere("Will I get rich?")
# mystical_octosphere("Are the Cubs going to win the World Series?")

# Instead of that, we now want a SimpleGUI frame (a popup window)
# with an input box to appear
# that the person can type their question into.

# The syntax to create a frame is:
# simplegui.create_frame(title, canvas_width, canvas_height)


# Create a SimpleGUI frame object here 
# with the title "Mystical Octosphere", a canvas
# width of 50, and a canvas height of 100.
# Save the frame that's created in a variable called frame.

myframe = simplegui.create_frame("Mystical Octosphere", 50, 180)

# That sounds complicated but it is just one line of code.
# For an example, look at line 22 of the default
# program that comes up when you open a new 
# window at codeskulptor.org
# Make sure the line is not indented at all.


# Now add an input field to the frame you made.

# The syntax to create an input field is:
# frame.add_input(label, input_handler, width)

# Make the label be "What is your question?".
# The input_handler is the function that will
# do something with the question, so that should 
# be mystical_octosphere. Make the width be 200.

myframe.add_input("What is your question?", mystical_octosphere, 200)

# That's it! You're done!
